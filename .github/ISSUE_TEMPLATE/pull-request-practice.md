We want to keep track of the names of employees. We are missing the new employee [[NEW EMPLOYEE NAME]] from the list. Add the name to either index.py or index.js.

*Acceptance criteria:*
I know this is done when [[NEW EMPLOYEE NAME]]'s name is included in the `employees` list/array in index.py or index.js.

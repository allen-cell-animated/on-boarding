#AICS Coding Practices & Onboarding Guide

**Who is this for?** Anyone developing software or scripts at the Allen Institute for Cell Science should make a plan to learn and follow best practices in styling, versioning, and collaborating on code development. This includes new employees or any AICS team members who are not yet familiar with the standards and methods that we will define and refer to in this document. This will be a living document that will evolve over months and years with contributions from instructors/mentors, and with feedback from learners.
